# Upgrade Notes

## v1 -> v2

### Vue-CLI

This lists some essentials, which had to be adapted in the Wegue code regarding to the upgrade to Vue-CLI in version 5.0.7:

- The command used to run the dev build is now `npm run serve`.
- Some new config files are present in the root directory. Take particular attention to `vue.config.js` used to configure the build process and `jsconfig.json` to configure `IDEs` integration.
- The main `HTML` template files which were present in the root directory are now in a `public` subfolder. Please adapt them to the needs of your Wegue application.
- The build configuration which was previously made inside the `build` and `config` directories should be placed in the `vue.config.js` file. Please adapt it to the needs of your Wegue application.  
The original `build` and `config` directories can be removed once this is done.
- Environment variables defined inside the `.env.js` files inside the `config` directory should be placed in `.env` files in the root directory.  
`dev.env.js` should now be called `.env.development`, `prod.env.js` should now be called `.env.production` and `test.env.js` should now be called `.env.test`.  
Please note than only `NODE_ENV`, `BASE_URL` and variables that start with `VUE_APP_` will be statically embedded into the client bundle. Please rename your variables in your Wegue application in case you use them after the build process.

Please refer to the official [Vue-CLI Guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) and [vue.config.js reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#vue-config-js) when you upgrade your Wegue app.

If you're using environment variables inside your Wegue app, please read [Vue-CLI's Modes and Environment Variables Guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html) carefully before updating your app.

`Vue-CLI` uses `Webpack 5` and `webpack-chain 6.5.1` under the hood. Please refer to [Vue-CLI's Working with Webpack guide](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/webpack.html), [Webpack configuration guide](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) and [webpack-chain documentation](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/tree/v6.5.1) if advanced configuration is needed inside your Wegue app.

### OpenLayers

This lists some essentials, which had to be adapted in the Wegue code regarding to the upgrade to OpenLayers in version 7/8/9:

- OL `Overlay` no longer accepts `autoPanAnimation` as an option.
 Now the animation delay is passed as an object directly to the autoPan option.
- `map.forEachLayerAtPixel()` is removed. Replaced with e.g. `map.getLayers().forEach()`.

Please have a look at the official [OpenLayers upgrade notes](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/main/changelog/upgrade-notes.md), when you upgrade your Wegue app. Especially look for any breaking change between OpenLayers v6.4.3 and the current OpenLayers version used in Wegue v2, see [package.json](https://github.com/wegue-oss/wegue/blob/master/package.json).

### Vuetify

This lists some essentials, which had to be adapted in the Wegue code regarding to the upgrade to Vuetify in version 2.6.15:

- The component `<v-content>` was renamed to `<v-main>`. Please adapt this in the `WguAppTemplate.vue` file of your Wegue application.

### MDI Icons

The MDI icon libraries used were upgraded to the following versions:

- `@mdi/font` => 7.2.x
- `material-icons` => 1.13.x

Please refer to the [official changelog](https://pictogrammers.com/docs/library/mdi/releases/changelog/) for versions later than `5.9.55` and check if you are using `removed` or `renamed` icons. Those have to be adapted and/or replaced in your Wegue application.

### ESLint

ESLint and its associated plugins were upgraded to the following versions:

- `eslint` => 7.32.x
- `eslint-plugin-standard` => 4.1.x
- `eslint-plugin-vue` => 7.20.x
- `eslint-config-standard` => 16.0.x
- `@vue/eslint-config-standard` => 6.1.x

As lots of new linting rules were added, you should expect to see error and warnings the first time you will build your updated Wegue app.  
The majority of those can be fixed automatically by running the `npm run lint:fix` command.  
If you want to momentarily bypass some advanced errors to test your upgraded app or want to adapt linting rules to better suit your preferences, you can modify the `.eslintrc.js` file as needed.
